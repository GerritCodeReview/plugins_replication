In this case, however, the cost of not having 3 lines of code for exposing a piece of code that is used anyway resulted in 52 extra lines of code that would not be needed.\n\nBottom line: it is best to have 3 lines of overhead rather than 52 lines of overhead, IMHO.\nHowever, I am open to challenges on the above :-)",
