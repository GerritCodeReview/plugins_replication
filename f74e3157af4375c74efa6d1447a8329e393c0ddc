Let me clarify a bit more:\nthe idea here is that we run two CGI scripts in the apache server receiving pushes\nform the replication plugin: the standard \"git-http-backend\" script and a new (which\nI may contribute) \"admin-ops\" script responsible for executing admin operations.\nBoth endpoints would be protected with the same .htpasswd file storing the username/password\nwhich we would store in the secure.config at the Gerrit master side.\nSince this apache server is fully dedicated to receiving pushes from Gerrit master and\nexecuting admin operations (create-project, delete-project) it makes perfect sense\nthat both endpoints use the same credentials.",
