Does the solution offer this possibility? If not, what approach would?",

      "message": "That is not the purpose as documented in Issue 13216. A target replication end like GitHub simply won\u0027t accept pushes with lots of refs: splitting a large push as a series of smaller and sequential pushes is the only way to replicate to those endpoints. It actually won\u0027t make it faster but slower than a single push with all the refs, but at least it will eventually succeed instead of always failing and retrying forever.\n\nPlease note that would \"solve\" a GitHub (or GitLab) problem by \"workaround\" on the Gerrit side.",
