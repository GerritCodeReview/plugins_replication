Sounds like a lot work to me (but I could be wrong). As it was said by Luca - that is not the purpose of this change and AFAIU single master would group it back to single push :D",

Whatever approach you take, I think it is important that you ensure that the on disk data reflect whatever replication is doing, and what replication work is outstanding. This is important not only to let other primaries potentially help out, but also to ensure that benefit of splitting the refs into smaller batches not be lost by primary restarts. In another words, if you manage to replicate 9K refs out of 10K refs to a site (say in batches of 1K), and then the primary goes down, it is important that when the server starts up again, that it not try to re-replicate those 9K refs which were already successful. Does your current approach do this?",

      "message": "AFAIU it will not be lost as `generateUpdates` asks remote for existing refs. IOW it will not try to resend 9K refs but only the remaining 1K as previous pushes succeeded. IMHO this looks like a small improvement over what we have now cuz if I\u0027m not mistaken we would push all 10K refs now... Having said that I believe that importance of having it accounted on the disk is not that important anymore ;).",

      "message": "I believe this change would do the job, bearing in mind that isn\u0027t designed and suitable for a multi-primary setup or for a remote pushed by different sources. Possibly this needs to be highlighted in the docs.\n\nHowever, I see the points from Nasser and Martin that at least we need to make sure that under those conditions it doesn\u0027t generate inconsistencies, or at least more than the ones we have already.\n\nExample:\nTwo Gerrit primaries (not in HA, not in MS) force pushing to the same remote, they will step into each other toes overwriting each other refs regardless of this change. Therefore that isn\u0027t a valid scenario but we need to make sure that we don\u0027t make it worse.\n\n@Jacek can you check the HA scenario (multi-primary) to make sure that this change doesn\u0027t create inconsistencies?\n\nRepo with 1000 refs, batch of 10 refs, two primaries pushing at the same time. To simulate a slow remote, you can add a 10s sleep between pushes.",
