Does the solution offer this possibility? If not, what approach would?",

      "message": "That is not the purpose as documented in Issue 13216. A target replication end like GitHub simply won\u0027t accept pushes with lots of refs: splitting a large push as a series of smaller and sequential pushes is the only way to replicate to those endpoints. It actually won\u0027t make it faster but slower than a single push with all the refs, but at least it will eventually succeed instead of always failing and retrying forever.\n\nPlease note that would \"solve\" a GitHub (or GitLab) problem by \"workaround\" on the Gerrit side.",

      "message": "But more importantly it is disabled by default and can be enabled/fine-tuned per remote.\n\n@Martin the idea is interesting but it would imply that division into batches happens on the scheduling level, gets serialised and individual batches could be picked up by any primary, right? Sounds like a lot work to me (but I could be wrong). As it was said by Luca - that is not the purpose of this change and AFAIU single master would group it back to single push :D",
