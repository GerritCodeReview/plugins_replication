Example: by extracting the replication-id and finding out all the refs associated with it.\n\nSplitting it to multiple lines would make grep through the replication_log more difficult.\nI never *read* the log but rather *process* the log with scripting.\n\nCan you preserve the ability to grep easily as well? Or can we simply drop the \u0027\\n\u0027 in the middle of the log message?",
