The unique part is maybe why more than 2 is considered \"too many\"? Maybe explain that after the sentence below or as an addition to it?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e default value 2 is chosen because whenever new patchset is created\n\u003e there are two refs (change ref and meta ref).\n\nThis is a good sentence on its own, but if you remove the intermediate sentence, you don\u0027t need to repeat \u0027default value 2\u0027. You could say \"The value 2 is chosen ...\"",
