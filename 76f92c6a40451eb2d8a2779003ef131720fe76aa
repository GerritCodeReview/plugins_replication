Whilst I am happy of the collaboration and improvements, I see the risk of this change getting too big: I have memory of a change in Gerrit that is still pending after 8 years and hundreds of patch-sets :-(\n\nWould it make sense to break it down into different steps and getting them merged one-by-one?\n\nWDYT?",
