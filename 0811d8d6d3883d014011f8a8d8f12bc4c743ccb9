      "message": "It is not clear to me why this class is using a counting lock instead of a synchronized, as the lock is more error prone since it requires an \"unlock\", but a synchronized is more like a try-with-resources in that it auto releases when the block is closed. I don\u0027t think this class is using any feature that the lock provides over a synchronized, and I think it is actually making this code harder to read.",
