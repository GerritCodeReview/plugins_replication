      "message": "It requires both modified Gerrit and replication plugin due to the fact that we manage users outside of the Gerrit - replica can access the user base directly without the necessity of \u0027refs/users/*\u0027 being replicated or not ;) In fact it is better if those refs are actually not replicated as they may collide in certain cases :D\n\nHaving said that I don\u0027t believe that this change is fundamentally wrong if the others don\u0027t want to have that option. All we need though is to have a possibility to provide alternative to AdminApiFactory implementation which is done in the referenced change ;)",
