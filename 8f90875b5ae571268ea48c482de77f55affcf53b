      "message": "I think seperating PatchsetReplicatedEvent from other ref replication event has some advantage:\n1. Patchset may has more interesting for tools that interact with gerrit, and these tools will not bother to differentiate which one is a patchset replication by compare \"refs/changes/\".\n2. PatchsetReplicatedEvent may provide more infomation about a change and patchset if some tools need them.",
