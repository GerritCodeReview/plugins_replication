      "message": "I think seperating PatchsetReplicatedEvent from other ref replication event has some advantage:\n1. Patchset may has more interesting for tools that interact with gerrit, and these tools will not bother to differentiate which one is a patchset replication by compare \"refs/changes/\".\n2. PatchsetReplicatedEvent may provide more infomation about a change and patchset if some tools need them.",

      "message": "If we take jenkins gerrit-trigger plugin for example, it will need other refs event, patchset-replicated is not enough. When a build is configured to trigger on ref-updated or change merged, it will need to wait for ref replicated which are not refs/changes.\n\nI still think it would be easier to just send ref-replicated event for any ref replicated. Tools won\u0027t have to differentiate ref-replicated since the patchset-created contains the ref name so the tools just need to wait for that specific ref to be replicated.",
