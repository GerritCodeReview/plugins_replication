If this is not the case, can you upload an example to the cookbook plugin which illustrates how this could be used? Also, can you add a test case to show this being replaced and working?",

Would that be reasonable proof of concept?\n\nHow is Collabnet replacing classes in a plugin. Is this a fork of the plugin, is the plugin being used from another plugin, is the plugin being used as a library? I think we need such a concept, of how this would be used to be documented in the codebase as a supported option for us to be able to support it. I do not think we should support the idea of adding code that is annotated as used by someone. I think that public documented examples in the code (preferably), or at least in another available plugin should be the expectation. Without this, I don\u0027t see how we can make decisions about how to alter code in a way that won\u0027t break the existing users of the code. That is not a burden that I believe an open source project should have.",
