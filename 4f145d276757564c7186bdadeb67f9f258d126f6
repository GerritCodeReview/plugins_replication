The change is already *very* big and I wouldn\u0027t increase the scope (and review time) even further.\n\nFor the pull-replication plugin, this refactoring is enough.\nFor other use-cases, we can go further and completely decouple the configuration from being a file.\n\nWill swap \u0027implementations\u0027 with \u0027subclasses\u0027, so that the ambiguity is removed.",
