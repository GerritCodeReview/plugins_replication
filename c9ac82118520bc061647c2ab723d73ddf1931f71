      "message": "out of curiosity: is there any benefit of calling next() prior actually doing the stuff? Would that end in the situation when runner.onDone() would be called prior runner.run(item) is performed? Would that be a problem then?\nI can imagine that \u0027replying\u0027 will be set to false prior the last replication event will be actually scheduled... It could potentially be a problem for tests (if they ever verify that ;)).\n\nSorry if I haven\u0027t understood it correct ;)",
