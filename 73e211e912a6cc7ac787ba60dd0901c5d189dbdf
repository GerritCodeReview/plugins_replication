      "message": "Why are we adding such a infrastructure component as Guava\u0027s EventBus in a (core) plugin and not in Gerrit Core? What if other plugins would also like to communicate with itself (or with each other) through EventBus, would they also have to bind another EventBus instance? Would it be an option to move EventBus to gerrit core?",
