      "message": "I wrote that code and back then, I did not find a normal scenario where the change was null so that\u0027s why I was throwing an exception.\n\nWe discovered that when a change is deleted, the GitReferenceUpdatedListener are notified after the change is remove from the database so this is a normal scenario where the change will be null. \n\nThe ideal would be a able to differentiate a delete change vs a missing change from the db but this is not possible here so I think that\u0027s ok to just do a null check without logging anything.",
