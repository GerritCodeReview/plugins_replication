      "message": "No, we didn\u0027t write a misleading log telling that there was an in-flight push when actually\nthe operation was canceled. See the line 306 in the PushOne:\n\n  if (!canceled) {\n     write the log...\n  }\n\nSo the log was never written when the push operation was canceled, and this aspect doesn\u0027t\nchange with this change. However, I can make this code even more explicit by having something like:\n\n  return RunwayStatus.canceled()\n\nso that the RunwayStatus provides the canceled flag. Don\u0027t know if this is worth the effort?\nWDYT?",
