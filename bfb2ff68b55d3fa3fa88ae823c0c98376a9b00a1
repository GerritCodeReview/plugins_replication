      "message": "The code in here looks all correct. I like the idea of using a Set, however to do so it also adds s a manually coded and potentially error prone equals() and hashcode(). This means that it comes with some risk for a stable branch without providing any functional benefit. i.e. this is not adding a test or a bug fix. It is a \"nice-to-have\" refactoring that I am not sure we should accept on a stable branch. My concern leaves me at a 0 vote.",
