      "message": "I do understand the reasoning behind this change, that it\u0027s fixing a regression introduced by adding `ApiModule`, and it\u0027s also the _simplest_ and _quickest_ way to fix that but...\n\nBut, one of the reasons why the `ApiModules` were introduced was to reduce the complexity of plugin deployment as it doesn\u0027t require plugin JARs being put in `lib/` and manual registration of `gerrit.installModule`. I feel that now we\u0027re adding even more complexity with a custom build target and an `replication-api.jar` in `plugins/`. This may lead to \"version mismatch\" when only the `replication.jar` will be updated.\n\nI get the reasoning behind it and also understand the technical limitations, but it doesn\u0027t feel good. üòê\n\nI don\u0027t have any better ideas, just wanted to be open about this, maybe someone will have a better idea for fixing this or maybe there\u0027s a better path forward.",
