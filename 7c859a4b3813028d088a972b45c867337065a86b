      "message": "Thanks for pushing this change. Just to add to this point, I think we discovered this bullet as an issue for us because in one of our internal plugins we inject the injector and use it to get an instance of a module we want to install only when the plugin isn\u0027t running on a replica. That started failing when the replication plugin was updated in core to declare an ApiModule with an error about `@PluginName` already being bound.\n\nWe probably needs some tests in core for usage of `Gerrit-ApiModule`. Right now the `TestPlugin` interface doesn\u0027t even know about it.",

      "message": "I do understand the reasoning behind this change, that it\u0027s fixing a regression introduced by adding `ApiModule`, and it\u0027s also the _simplest_ and _quickest_ way to fix that but...\n\nBut, one of the reasons why the `ApiModules` were introduced was to reduce the complexity of plugin deployment as it doesn\u0027t require plugin JARs being put in `lib/` and manual registration of `gerrit.installModule`. I feel that now we\u0027re adding even more complexity with a custom build target and an `replication-api.jar` in `plugins/`. This may lead to \"version mismatch\" when only the `replication.jar` will be updated.\n\nI get the reasoning behind it and also understand the technical limitations, but it doesn\u0027t feel good. üòê\n\nI don\u0027t have any better ideas, just wanted to be open about this, maybe someone will have a better idea for fixing this or maybe there\u0027s a better path forward.",
