IMO it\u0027s worth mentioning that the `$gerrit_site/etc/secure.config` was used by the plugin, but it was assumed that values are in the plain text format. It maybe also worth mentioning that Gerrit core already has `SecureConfig` API that should be used here instead.",

I will add one additional logging to mention the case were there is no value (as warning).",
