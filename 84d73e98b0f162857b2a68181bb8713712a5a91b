      "message": "Hello @martin.fick@linaro.org,\n\n@nasser.grainawi@linaro.org asked to add this test in[1]. It checks that the same project with the same URL is issuing a single task of replication, not sure how I can explain this better... this is the existing (current master) implementation.\n\nIf it is not requried, I will be happy to remove it.\n\nThanks,\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/replication/+/355763/1..7//COMMIT_MSG#b12",

      "message": "Some things this CM needs:\n\n1) What it is doing (\"add new test...\", or \"fix existing test to...\", ...)\n2) Why (\"a valid UC is not currently covered\", \"an existing test is wrong/broken...\", ...)\n\nI mention those two things because those are the most prominent questions I currently have for this change. There are likely other things that would help, and fortunately there are some good guides out there to help, here is an example https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/ that is probably worth reading. But I would be able to review the change better and offer better advice on it if it had just those 2 extra things.",
