      "message": "Starting with WDYT: This change belongs here.\n\nThere\u0027s no docs or anything saying it *shouldn\u0027t* work. I agree there is a specific feature planned for 3.3 which *requires* a MM setup, but to me that\u0027s different from being MM-compatible. We should always aim for MM compatibility and adding tests to ensure that compatibility isn\u0027t broken is a Good Thing.\n\nDoes the commit message need to be improved to explain that? I assume any change adding tests is doing so either because 1) it\u0027s codifying something that already works or 2) it\u0027s demonstrating something that fails. This change is #1.",
