If I do remove that annotation in a separate change, then if, for any reason, we need to revert this change, we end up in a broken state, as the annotation will still be removed.\n\nSure, that\u0027s _easy_ to fix, just rever another change, but one needs to remember that this refactoring was split into two separate commits.\n\nThat\u0027s the reason why I tend to \"put more changes\" into commits, as I do believe in the mantra that each commit should be atomic and move the repository from one stable state to the next one, and not break it when a single commit is reverted.",
