All tasks should be created in the \"building/\" directory and then moved to the \"waiting/\" directory so that they are never \"partial\". If these are happening in the \"running/\" directory it is even weirder. It might be worth tracking down the source of this \"instability\" instead of covering it up silently (which is what this change does).",
