      "message": "\u003e Well, I think even without multi-master one might prefer not to replicate everything on startup, especially if that involves thousands of projects to be replicated.\n\nI tend to agree with Eryk: it all depends on how many projects you have and how many remotes you have. With tens of thousands of projects and hundreds of remotes, triggering the replication of everything to everywhere is definitely a no-go (e.g. 10k projects x 100 remotes \u003d 1M pushes, it will take forever).\n\nAlso with a smaller number of projects (e.g. 100 and a few remotes like 10) it will still generate a huge number of pushes.\n\nI believe what Eryk is proposing makes sense: *some* projects could be super critical to be always pushed at start, others are not. Bearing in mind that a git push even when there is nothing to push would still go through the refs advertisement phase that could potentially take a very long time.",

      "message": "I think this using this \"feature\" is fundamentally asking for a broken setup with the hopes that no one notices, and I think it would be bad advice to let the users of the replication plugin think that this is a good idea.\n\nWe don\u0027t have 1M replication events, but we do have 100K events, and we still expect to never loose events and we ensure that replicate start all is run after any master server goes down. We have 9 master servers, and we restart them weekly, (which does create close to 1M events) and this does scale for us, and there are several existing proposed major improvements that will make this much better even, and many that could still be done (git protocol v2!). I don\u0027t think that it is unreasonable to think that if a service has 1M replication events that this can be handled by the replication plugin with the right amount of server horsepower.\n\nTurning a feature off is not a scaling solution, and I think we are doing a dis-service to the community if we don\u0027t seek and apply solutions to scalability problems instead of turning features off. This change https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/replication/+/267812 can greatly reduce the impact of massive startup replication, it would be good if Luca could try this change, and also the MM master fixes here https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/replication/+/265572 before giving up on making replication reliable for \"all-but-a-select-few\" projects on a server. I would rather we fix our code base than we add workarounds for performance \"bugs\".\n\nIs there any reason for this change other than the current performance issue?",

We do it because we have an external customization that fires this at time more appropriate for a multi-master setup. This customization is specific to a specific multi-master implementation, and it would not be appropriate currently for the replication plugin to have to carry code that we could not recommend that others in the community to use. Since what you are trying to do is currently possible to achieve without modifying the replication plugin (via a startup script wrapper which calls replicate start on the projects you want) I don\u0027t think the community should bare the burden of this config option without a strong use case that we could recommend the community to use.",
