      "message": "Yes, but that\u0027s an existing gap (there are no \"canStart\" type tests in here yet). This change isn\u0027t trying to address that gap. I think I suggested to Kaushik that he upload a change for it, but I think it got lost in other communication. I can push a change for it now on top of this.",

      "message": "You are outlining a different gap I believe. Before your change, this change tested both \"waiting\" and \"running\", in this change it no longer does, that is a new gap. At a minimum to be on par with the code before this change you should replace the list() with both listWaiting() and listRunning(). But once you go that far, it probably makes sense to place the listWaitings() more appropriately then here (before the \"finish\"). This better placement was not possible before the split, but seems appropriate as part of the split, not something that should wait for a follow-on.",
