      "message": "We have actually been running this patch in production for a few days now, and I think that it is not fine grained enough.  If I understand, the URI does not contain the ref being pushed which means that this completely serializes all the pushes per project?\n\nSince we have several active projects that take a while to replicate ~20-30s, this can be problematic when there are several changes in one of those projects needing replication.   In effect, what was a decent replication time 30s, can now become several minutes instead.   I am not sure that serializing everything without regards to the refs is wise; there is no reason that multiple changes shouldn\u0027t be pushed in parallel, is there?",
