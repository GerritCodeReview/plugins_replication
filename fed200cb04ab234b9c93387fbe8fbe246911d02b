      "message": "Is reading the `username` from the `replication.config`, rather than the `SecureStore` an intentional change?\n\nIf so, I think this is arguably a separate change (this change only `uses SecureStore to access replication credentials`) and I think it should be addressed separately.\n\nthe documentation still states that both `username` and `password` should come from `the secure.config` [1]\n \nLastly, since this constitutes a breaking change compared to the previous implementation,how do we make sure this doesn\u0027t go unnoticed and it gets mentioned in the release notes (since this is a `core` plugin) as a breaking change?\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/replication/+/refs/heads/master/src/main/resources/Documentation/config.md#file-2",
