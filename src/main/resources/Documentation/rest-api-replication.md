There are two supported variants of the command, `all` and `project`.

### <a id="get-content">Start Replication for Project
POST /plugins/replication/start
#### Request
```
POST /plugins/replication/start HTTP/1.0

  {
    "command" : "project",
    "project" : "repo1",
  }
```

#### Response

  {
    "command" : "all",

```

OPTIONS
--------

Applicable to both variants above.

"now" : true (default=false)

Start replicating right away without waiting the per remote replication delay.

---

"wait" : true (default=false)

Wait for replication to finish before exiting.

---

"url" : "\<PATTERN\>"

Replicate only to replication destinations whose URL contains the substring `PATTERN`.
This can be useful to replicate only to a previously down node, which has been brought back
online.

    "now" : true
  }
```

#### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 204 NO_CONTENT
```

Replicate only projects located in the `documentation` subdirectory, start immediately
and wait for completion:

#### Request

    "project" : "documentation/*",
