      "message": "I think this should be check, because shouldReplicate is called by schedule, which actually schedules replication if it is allowed.\n\nDigging a little deeper, it looks like shouldReplicate is also called by wouldPushProject, which is used by ReplicationQueue to determine whether to call schedule. This feels a bit more like a \"test\" use case. But that would require much more work to split up the shouldReplicate/wouldPushProject paths, so I think we should use test to be safe.\n\n(This suggests another potential API change: test(Permission, boolean strict))",
