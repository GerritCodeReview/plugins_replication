      "message": "This was my original implementation that is not introducing a new event as I did for 3.6. Since the issue apparently did not hit a lot of users, I would abandon this workaround until specifically requested. Otherwise, versions 3.3-3.5 would diverge from 3.6 and master. This will make maintaining those branches more difficult.",
